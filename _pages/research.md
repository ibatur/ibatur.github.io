The transportation industry is facing challenges related to sustainability, climate change, and equity, while being impacted by population growth, technological advancement, demographic and cultural changes, and shifts in work and shopping patterns. My research aligns with the new transportation paradigm, which aims to provide services and infrastructure for the movement of people and goods, as well as goals such as universal accessibility, improved economic efficiency, enhanced resilience, and reduced environmental impacts. My research focuses on sustainability and equity in urban transportation systems, and aims to understand the uncertainties, opportunities, vulnerabilities, and trade-offs presented by social, economic, and technological transformations in the industry. In my research, I use analytical techniques such as econometrics modeling, machine learning, probability and statistics, simulation, data analytics, and operations research. 

My research can be divided into two main areas. The first is concerned with the sustainability and equity impacts of emerging transportation technologies, such as ridehailing services and autonomous vehicles. This includes studying the impacts of ridehailing services on public transportation, car ownership, and their potential use in an autonomous vehicle future. I also examine the potential impacts of autonomous vehicles on the transportation system from various angles, including zero-occupant trips, early adopters, and the choice between private ownership and shared use. 

The second focus of my research is on understanding the impact of activity time-use patterns on overall well-being and equity. To do this, I have developed well-being indicators based on time use surveys to identify vulnerable groups experiencing lower well-being and how transportation systems can contribute to their well-being. I have also demonstrated the practicality of these well-being indicators in the transportation context. I created an open-source online well-being platform that can be used by the public, policy-makers, and practitioners to track well-being in society. This aspect of my research formed my doctoral dissertation, and and I have written more about it in my blog posts.

Overall, my research aims to improve our understanding of transportation patterns and behaviors, and to support the development of sustainable and equitable transportation policies and strategies.
