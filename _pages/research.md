My research focuses on the intersection of sustainability, resilience, and equity within urban transportation systems, aiming to understand the uncertainties, opportunities, vulnerabilities, and trade-offs brought about by widespread social, economic, and technological transformations. Through novel data collection, innovative analytical methods, and policy-relevant insights, my work contributes to the development of future transportation systems that are sustainable, resilient, and inclusive. My research is structured around four interconnected pillars, which provide a robust framework for addressing critical challenges in the transportation landscape.

**Research Pillars**:  
1. **Travel Behavior and Demand Modeling**  
   - Designing surveys, analyzing trends, and forecasting transportation needs to support informed decision-making in dynamic urban environments  

2. **Societal Wellbeing and Accessibility**  
   - Investigating the relationship between transportation systems, activity-travel patterns, and societal wellbeing

3. **Emerging Mobility Technologies**  
   - Exploring the adoption pathway and sustainability implications of emerging mobility technologies like autonomous vehicles, ridehailing services, and electric vehicles

4. **Human Adaptation to Extreme Environments**  
   - Examining how transportation systems can adapt to extreme conditions and environment, such as pandemic, extreme cold, heatwaves, flooding, and wildfires

My work combines advanced methodologies, including econometric modeling, machine learning, and data visualization, to analyze complex datasets and translate insights into actionable strategies for stakeholders.
