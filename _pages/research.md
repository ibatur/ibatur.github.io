In my research, I focus on the intersection of sustainability and equity in urban transportation systems. I aim to understand the challenges, opportunities, and trade-offs that arise from social, economic, and technological transformations in the industry. My research can be divided into two main areas.

 The first is concerned with the sustainability and equity impacts of emerging transportation technologies, such as ride-hailing services and autonomous vehicles. This includes studying the impacts of ridehailing services on public transportation, car ownership, and their potential use in an autonomous vehicle future. I also examine the potential impacts of autonomous vehicles on the transportation system from various angles, including zero-occupant trips, early adopters, and the choice between private ownership and shared use. 

The second focus of my research is on understanding the impact of activity time-use patterns on overall wellbeing and equity. To do this, I have developed wellbeing indicators based on time use surveys to identify vulnerable groups experiencing lower wellbeing and how transportation systems can contribute to their wellbeing. I have also demonstrated the practicality of these wellbeing indicators in the transportation context. I created an open-source online wellbeing platform that can be used by the public, policy-makers, and practitioners to track wellbeing in society. This aspect of my research formed my doctoral dissertation, and and I have written more about it in my blog posts.

Overall, my research aims to improve our understanding of mobility patterns and behaviors, and to support the development of sustainable and equitable transportation policies and strategies. To conduct my research, I use analytical techniques such as econometrics modeling, machine learning, probability and statistics, simulation, data analytics, and operations research.
