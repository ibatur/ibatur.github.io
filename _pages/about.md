Welcome!

I am an Assistant Research Professor in the [School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment](https://ssebe.engineering.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University (ASU). I hold a PhD in Civil, Environmental, and Sustainable Engineering from ASU, along with an MS in Industrial and System Engineering from Istanbul Sehir University and a BS in Industrial Engineering from TOBB Economy and Technology University. My research interests include travel behavior, sustainable and equitable transportation, emerging transportation technologies, human resilience and adaptation, travel demand forecasting, statistical and econometric modeling, and machine learning.

In addition to my faculty role, I serve as the Assistant Director of the [TOMNET University Transportation Center](https://tomnet-utc.engineering.asu.edu/) and the [National Center for Understanding Future Travel Behavior and Demand (TBD)](https://tbd.ctr.utexas.edu/). I am also an active member of the Traveler Behavior and Values Committee (AEP30) of the Transportation Research Board, contributing to advancing research and policy in transportation systems.
