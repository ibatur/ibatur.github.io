Welcome!

I am an Associate Research Technologist at Arizona State University's School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment, where I am currently pursuing a PhD in Civil, Environmental, and Sustainable Engineering. My research interests include travel behavior, sustainable and equitable transportation, emerging transportation technologies, travel demand forecasting, smart cities, and machine learning. I received my MS in Industrial and System Engineering from Istanbul Sehir University in 2014 and my BS in Industrial Engineering from TOBB Economy and Technology University in 2012.

In my current role, I have led multiple research projects as principal or co-principal investigator at the [TOMNET University Transportation Center](https://tomnet-utc.engineering.asu.edu/), totaling more than $500,000 in funding. My work has been featured in journals such as Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, Transportation Research Record, and Cities. Along with conducting research, I have also been involved in proposal writing and have developed open-source software and tools. I have mentored undergraduate and graduate students working at the Center as well.

In addition to my research efforts, I also serve as the Research Communications and Technology Transfer Coordinator at the TOMNET UTC, managing internal and external communications and coordinating technology transfer activities for the Center. As a Graduate Teaching Associate at Arizona State University, I have also assisted with courses in activity-travel behavior modeling, transportation engineering, transportation systems planning, life cycle assessment, and numerical methods for engineers. 

I am dedicated to staying up-to-date on the latest research and technologies in my field and am passionate about sharing my knowledge and expertise through publishing, teaching, service, and mentorship.
